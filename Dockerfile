# June-X Ultra (loader distribution) — container image.
# Node 20 is pinned on purpose: better-sqlite3 11.10.0 is validated on it.
# Do not bump the major without retesting the native build.
#
# NOTE: this image ships only the LOADER. At startup it downloads the real
# bot source (REPO_URL, overridable via env) into node_modules/xsqlite3/
# and runs it from there; the bot's require() calls resolve against this
# image's node_modules.
